2019-01-18	Application Design Based on Intelligent Technology of Wholegarment Computerized Flat Knitting Machine	Shanghai Textile Science & Technology	As the manufacturing industry continues to transform and upgrade, the knitwear manufacturing sector urgently needs to move away from traditional labor-intensive production models. This text discusses the progress of fully fashioned computerized flat knitting machine technology in the field of intelligent manufacturing and conducts a detailed application study on Shima Seiki's fully fashioned knitting technology. The analysis explores both the hardware structure of the Mach2XS type four-bed fully fashioned computerized flat knitting machine and the design methods and principles of the SDS-ONE design system. The results show that fully fashioned knitting technology has advanced features in products, production models, and conceptual methods, which will have a profound impact on the field of intelligent manufacturing in multiple aspects.

2022-10-18	Digital Design Strategies and Process Research on Children's Wearable Wholegarment Knitted Masks	Shanghai Textile Science & Technology	The design process of children's fully fashioned knitted masks is elaborated from the aspects of style structure and molding process. The knitting processes for the mask body, ear straps, and the interior of the mask are introduced. The results indicate that the use of fully fashioned knitting technology can achieve one-time molding of children's masks. In the design of the functional layer, a replaceable filter cartridge structure can be utilized to accommodate filters with various functions, which is of great significance for enhancing the comfort of wearing children's masks and reducing resource wastage.

title: "Design of Multi-layer Composite Structures on the SVR 123SP Flat Knitting Machine"
collection: publications
permalink: /files/paper4/
excerpt: 'Explain the design principles of multi-layer composite structures, based on the SVR 123SP flat knitting machine&apos;s weft insertion knitting technology, design and develop three types of multi-layer composite knit fabrics: corrugated weft insertion structures, jacquard weft insertion structures, and imitation shuttle-woven style structures. Provide a detailed introduction to the raw material specifications, structure design, and knitting principles, and highlight the key points in the research and development of multi-layer composite structures as well as their application directions, which has certain guiding significance for enterprises developing such products.'

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'As the manufacturing industry continues to transform and upgrade, the knitwear manufacturing sector urgently needs to move away from traditional labor-intensive production models. This text discusses the progress of fully fashioned computerized flat knitting machine technology in the field of intelligent manufacturing and conducts a detailed application study on Shima Seiki's fully fashioned knitting technology. The analysis explores both the hardware structure of the Mach2XS type four-bed fully fashioned computerized flat knitting machine and the design methods and principles of the SDS-ONE design system. The results show that fully fashioned knitting technology has advanced features in products, production models, and conceptual methods, which will have a profound impact on the field of intelligent manufacturing in multiple aspects.'

With the waves of globalization and technological advancement, the fashion industry is facing unprecedented changes. Currently, the industry requires not only creative professionals but also practical, application-oriented talents adaptable to new business models. This study aims to explore and analyze the changes brought by the transformation and upgrade of the fashion industry, and through empirical research at the Fashion College of Shanghai Sanda University (hereafter referred to as "X Fashion College"), it seeks to identify existing problems and their causes. It strives to construct an application-oriented undergraduate talent cultivation model integrated with industry and education, providing guidance and reference for relevant institutions and enterprises.
This research originates from the policy orientation of applied undergraduate higher education and the current development characteristics of China's fashion industry. Based on a literature review summarizing predecessors' explorations and practical achievements, this study proposes key issues to be addressed in the fashion industry's industry-education integrated talent cultivation model and develops a two-stage research methodology centered on X Fashion College as the primary case study.
In the interview section, it was found that the transformation of the fashion industry led to changes in talent demand, with a lack of scientifically rational and feasible integrated talent cultivation models in applied undergraduate institutions. This is evident in the mismatch between universities' education and enterprises' employment needs, the disconnection between teaching resources and industry technological changes, and the asynchrony between teaching practices and industry development. The study proposes three dimensions of research: "preconditions," "construction phase," and "operational mode."
In the current situation depiction, based on interview data and observations of X Fashion Institute's discipline construction and project cases, the study summarizes its explorations in the "three dimensions" of integrated talent cultivation.
In the survey questionnaire section, first-hand data from graduates and industry practitioners are collected and analyzed to identify the main reasons for problems in the "three key points" of fashion industry education integration. Factors such as students' learning willingness, practical training conditions, faculty, curriculum system, project introduction, teaching materials, and project output distribution are analyzed, with countermeasures proposed.
After further analysis, the study finds that these issues ultimately point to the "three dimensions," which are both the construction path and the source of current shortcomings in the integrated talent cultivation model. The proposed path includes reaching consensus between schools and enterprises, improving policies, building a cooperation foundation, jointly creating talent cultivation platforms and discipline carriers, integrating courses with projects, establishing project-based studios for teachers and students, and creating mechanisms for project output and transformation. These dimensions are interrelated, forming a complete implementation framework for the integrated talent cultivation model.
